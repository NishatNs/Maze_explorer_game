# Maze Explorer (PyOpenGL)

Maze Explorer is a 2D grid-based maze game built with **Python** and **PyOpenGL (GLUT)**.  
A random maze is generated each run, and the player must **collect all gold** and then reach the **goal** before the **time limit** ends — while avoiding obstacles.

## Gameplay Rules
- The maze is a **25×25 grid**.
- You start at **(0,0)** and the goal is at **(24,24)**.
- The maze contains:
  - **Gold (yellow circles)** → collect them all
  - **Obstacles (red circles)** → touching an obstacle ends the game
- You win only if:
  1) **All gold is collected**, and  
  2) You reach the **goal** square.
- If time runs out, the game ends.

## Features (based on the code)
- Random maze generation using a grid-based algorithm (paths + walls)
- Real-time movement with arrow keys and wall collision checking
- Gold placement and collection system
- Obstacle placement system (game over on collision)
- Time limit (default: **120 seconds**) with live countdown
- Mouse UI buttons:
  - **Restart** button resets the maze and game state
  - **Pause** button pauses gameplay and timer updates
- Simple character drawing using custom point/line/circle drawing logic
